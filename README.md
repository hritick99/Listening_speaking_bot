# Speak Function Project

This project aims to demonstrate the usage of a speak function. The project utilizes a microphone to take input, processes it using various langchain agents such as Wikipedia and SerpApi, along with the OpenAI API to fetch relevant answers, and then outputs the results using a speaker, as well as displaying them on the screen.

## Functionality

1. **Input from Microphone**: The project captures input from the microphone.
2. **Langchain Agents Integration**: Various langchain agents including Wikipedia and SerpApi are used to process the input.
3. **OpenAI API Integration**: The processed input is further analyzed using the OpenAI API to fetch relevant answers.
4. **Output via Speaker**: The results obtained from the langchain agents and the OpenAI API are read out using a speaker.
5. **Display on Screen**: Additionally, the results are displayed on the screen for visual feedback.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need to install Python packages using `pip`.

3. **Configure OpenAI API**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it up in the project configuration.

4. **Set up Langchain Agents**: Obtain necessary API keys for langchain agents like SerpApi and configure them in the project.

5. **Run the Project**: Execute the main script to run the project.

## Usage

1. Launch the project by running the main script.
2. Speak into the microphone to provide input.
3. Wait for the response as it processes the input using langchain agents and the OpenAI API.
4. The response will be read out using the speaker and displayed on the screen.
